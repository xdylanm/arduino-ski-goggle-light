# Clip on Light

This project is a take on using capacitive touch to scroll through different lighting modes with neo-pixels. The lights are driven by an ATTiny85 on an [Arduino-compatible board](https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting). The case and clip are 3D printed, and should screw together with M3 nuts & bolts.
